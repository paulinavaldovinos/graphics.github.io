<h2 id="filetypes">Graphic File Types</h2>
  <p>Image 1: This image is a graph and the best file format for this might be SVG,these formats can be edited when 
    information needs to be added.</p>
  <p>Image 2: This image is best in JPEG format, because it is an image of a monkey and that format allows those images 
  to show nicely because of the millions of colors that are available in their palette. </p>
  <p>Image 3: This is a photo in landscape mode of a snowy mountain with a beautiful sky. This can be best viewed in 
  a GIF format so it can animate the beautiful clowdy sky.</p>
  <p>Image 4: PNG-8 is best suited for this image , because of the few puzzle pieces that can be shown as more vibrant
  with this format</p>
  <p>Image 5: A simple PNG format will give the Stop sign image what it needs to be shown.</p>
